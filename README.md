FamilyTree Web app
=================

This is a prototype of a Web app that displays the hierarchy tree of a selected family.

This prototype is for demonstration purpose and thus the family members data is hard-coded i.e. there is no backing Web server.

It is intended that the prototype will be developed into a full-fledged Web app with a remote Node server that will serve actual family data. At present NodeJS must have been installed on the local machine.

*Steps to serve files locally*

```
git clone https://github.com/davidtonthat/familytrees.git
cd familytrees
npm init -y
npm install

node server.js
```

Connect browser to http://localhost:8000

*Login credentials*

```
Username: guest

Password: password
```

The browser window should be approximately 80% of screen size to display the largest family tree of the test 'Smith' family.

The usage is mostly self-explanatory.
