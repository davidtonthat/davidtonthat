FamilyTree Web app
=================

This is a prototype of a Web app that displays the hierarchy tree of a selected family.

This prototype is for demonstration purpose and thus the family members data is hard-coded i.e. there is no backing Web server.

It is intended that the prototype will be developed into a full-fledged Web app with a Node server that will serve actual family data.

The browser window should be approximately 80% of screen size to display the largest family tree of the test 'Smith' family.

The usage is mostly self-explanatory.
